#11. Editing Models and Validation

##Editing Models and Validation

TornadoFX doesn't force any par ticular architectural pattern on you as a developer, and it works equally well with both **MVC**, **MVP**, and their derivatives.

To help with implementing these patterns TornadoFX provides a tool called `ViewModel` that helps cleanly separate your `UI` and business logic, giving you features like rollback/commit and dirty state checking.
These patterns are hard or cumbersome to implement manually, so it is advised to leverage the ViewModel and `ItemViewModel` when it is needed.

Typically you will use the `ItemViewModel` when you are creating a facade in front of a single object, and a `ViewModel` for more complex situations.

##A Typical Use Case

Let's say we have a certain domain type `Person`. 
We will allow its two properties to be nullable so that they can be entered later by the user.
```kotlin
import tornadofx.*

class Person(name: String? = null, title: String? = null) {
    val nameProperty = SimpleStringProperty(this, "name", name)
    var name by nameProperty

    val titleProperty = SimpleStringProperty(this, "title", title)
    var title by titleProperty 
}
```
(**Notice** the import, you need to import at least `tornadofx.getValue` and `tornadofx.setValue` for the by delegate to work)

Consider a Master/Detail view where you have a `TableView` displaying a list of people, and a `Form` where the currently selected person's information can be edited. 
Before we get into the `ViewModel`, we will create a version of this `View` without using the `ViewModel`.


Figure 11.1

The code below is our first attempt to build this, and it has some problems that we will address.
```kotlin
import javafx.scene.control.TableView
import javafx.scene.control.TextField
import javafx.scene.layout.BorderPane
import tornadofx.*

class Person(name: String? = null, title: String? = null) {
    val nameProperty = SimpleStringProperty(this, "name", name)
    var name by nameProperty

    val titleProperty = SimpleStringProperty(this, "title", title)
    var title by titleProperty 
}

class PersonEditor : View("Person Editor") {
    override val root = BorderPane()
    var nameField : TextField by singleAssign()
    var titleField : TextField by singleAssign()
    var personTable : TableView<Person> by singleAssign()
    // Some fake data for our table
    val persons = listOf(Person("John", "Manager"), Person("Jay", "Worker bee")).observable()

    var prevSelection: Person? = null

    init {
        with(root) {
            // TableView showing a list of people
            center {
                tableview(persons) {
                    personTable = this
                    column("Name", Person::nameProperty)
                    column("Title", Person::titleProperty)

                    // Edit the currently selected person
                    selectionModel.selectedItemProperty().onChange {
                        editPerson(it)
                        prevSelection = it
                    }
                }
            }

            right {
                form {
                    fieldset("Edit person") {
                        field("Name") {
                            textfield() {
                                nameField = this
                            }
                        }
                        field("Title") {
                            textfield() {
                                titleField = this
                            }
                        }
                        button("Save").action {
                            save()
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

    private fun editPerson(person: Person?) {
        if (person != null) {
            prevSelection?.apply {
                nameProperty.unbindBidirectional(nameField.textProperty())
                titleProperty.unbindBidirectional(titleField.textProperty())
            }
            nameField.bind(person.nameProperty)
            titleField.bind(person.titleProperty)
            prevSelection = person
        }
    }

    private fun save() {
        // Extract the selected person from the tableView
        val person = personTable.selectedItem!!

        // A real application would persist the person here
        println("Saving ${person.name} / ${person.title}")
    }
}
```
We define a `View` consisting of a `TableView` in the center of a `BorderPane` and a `Form` on the right side. 
We define some properties for the form fields and the table itself so we can reference them later.

While we build the table, we attach a listener to the selected item so we can call the editPerson function when the table selection changes. 
The `editPerson` function binds the properties of the selected person to the text fields in the `form`.

##Problems with our initial attempt

At first glance it might look OK, but when we dig deeper there are several issues.

##Manual binding

Every time the selection in the table changes, we have to unbind/rebind the data for the form fields manually.
Apart from the added code and logic, there is another huge problem with this: the data is updated for every change in the text fields, and the changes will even be reflected in the table.
While this might look cool and is technically correct, it presents one big problem: what if the user does not want to save the changes? We have no way of rolling back.
So to prevent this, we would have to skip the binding altogether and manually extract the values from the text fields, then create a new `Person` object on `save`. 
In fact, this is a pattern found in many applications and expected by most users.
Implementing a `"Reset"` button for this form would mean managing variables with the initial values and again assigning those values manually to the `text` fields.

##Tight Coupling

Another issue is when it is time to save the edited person, the save function has to extract the selected item from the table again. 
For that to happen the save function has to know about the `TableView`. 
Alternatively it would have to know about the text fields like the `editPerson` function does, and manually extract the values to reconstruct a `Person` object.

##Introducing ViewModel

The `ViewModel` is a mediator between the `TableView` and the `Form`. 
It acts as a middleman between the data in the text fields and the data in the actual `Person` object. 
As you will see, the code is much shorter and easier to reason about.
The implementation code of the `PersonModel` will be shown shortly. 
For now just focus on its usage.
Please **note** that this is not the recommended syntax, this merely serves as an explanation of the concepts.
```kotlin
class PersonEditor : View("Person Editor") {
    override val root = BorderPane()
    val persons = listOf(Person("John", "Manager"), Person("Jay", "Worker bee")).observable()
    val model = PersonModel(Person())

    init {
        with(root) {
            center {
                tableview(persons) {
                    column("Name", Person::nameProperty)
                    column("Title", Person::titleProperty)

                    // Update the person inside the view model on selection change
                    model.rebindOnChange(this) { selectedPerson ->
                        item = selectedPerson ?: Person()
                    }
                }
            }

            right {
                form {
                    fieldset("Edit person") {
                        field("Name") {
                            textfield(model.name)
                        }
                        field("Title") {
                            textfield(model.title)
                        }
                        button("Save") {
                            enableWhen(model.dirty)
                            action {
                                save()
                            }
                        }
                        button("Reset").action {
                            model.rollback()
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

    private fun save() {
        // Flush changes from the text fields into the model
        model.commit()

        // The edited person is contained in the model
        val person = model.item

        // A real application would persist the person here
        println("Saving ${person.name} / ${person.title}")
    }

}
class PersonModel(person: Person) : ItemViewModel<Person>(person) {
    val name = bind(Person::nameProperty)
    val title = bind(Person::titleProperty)
}
```
This looks a lot better, but what exactly is going on here? We have introduced a subclass of `ViewModel` called `PersonModel`.
The model holds a `Person` object and has properties for the name and title fields.
We will discuss the model further after we have looked at the rest of the client code.

**Note** that we hold no reference to the `TableView` or the text fields. 
Apart from a lot less code, the first big change is the way we update the `Person` inside the model:
```kotlin

model.rebindOnChange(this) { selectedPerson ->
    person = selectedPerson ?: Person()
}
```
The `rebindOnChange()` function takes the `TableView` as an argument and a function that will be called when the selection changes. 
This works with `ListView`,`TreeView`, `TreeTableView`, and any other `ObservableValue` as well.
This function is called on the model and has the `selectedPerson` as its single argument.
We assign the selected person to the person property of the model, or a new `Person` if the selection was empty/null.
That way we ensure that there is always data for the model to present.

When we create the `TextFields`, we bind the model properties directly to it since most `Node` builders accept an `ObservableValue` to bind to.
```kotlin

field("Name") {
    textfield(model.name)
```
}
Even when the selection changes, the model properties persist but the values for the properties are updated.
We totally avoid the manual binding from our previous attempt.

Another big change in this version is that the data in the table does not update when we type into the text fields. 
This is because the model has exposed a copy of the properties from the person object and does not write back into the actual person object before we call `model.commit()`.
This is exactly what we do in the `save` function. 
Once `commit` has been called, the data in the facade is flushed back into our `person` object and the table will now reflect our changes.

##Rollback

Since the model holds a reference to the actual `Person` object, we can reset the `text` fields to reflect the actual data in our `Person` object.
We could add a reset button like this:
```kotlin
button("Reset").action {
    model.rollback()
}
```
When the button is pressed, any changes are discarded and the `text` fields show the actual `Person` object values again.

##The PersonModel

We never explained how the `PersonModel` works yet, and you probably have been wondering about how the `PersonModel` is implemented. 
Here it is:
```kotlin
class PersonModel(person: Person) : ItemViewModel<Person>(person) {
    val name = bind(Person::nameProperty)
    val title = bind(Person::titleProperty)
}
```
It can hold a `Person` object, and it has defined two strange-looking properties called name and title via the bind delegate.
Yeah it looks weird, but there is a very good reason for it.
The `{ person.nameProperty }` parameter for the bind function is a lambda that returns a property.
This returned property is examined by the `ViewModel`, and a new property of the same type is created. 
It is then put into the name property of the `ViewModel`.

When we bind a `text` field to the name property of the model, only the copy is updated when you type into the `text` field.
The `ViewModel` keeps track of which actual property belongs to which facade, and when you call `commit` the values from the facade are flushed into the actual backing property. 
On the flip side, when you call rollback the exact opposite happens: The actual property value is flushed into the facade.

The reason the actual property is wrapped in a function is that this makes it possible to change the person variable and then extract the property from that new person.
You can read more about this below (rebinding).

##Dirty Checking

The model has a `Property` called dirty.
This is a `BooleanBinding` which you can observe to enable or disable certain features.
For example, we could easily disable the save button until there are actual changes.
The updated save button would look like this:
```kotlin
button("Save") {
    enableWhen(model.dirty)
    action {
        save()
    }
}
```
There is also a plain val called `isDirty` which returns a `Boolean` representing the dirty state for the entire model.

One thing to note is that if the backing object is being modified while the `ViewModel` is also modified via the `UI`, all uncommitted changes in the `ViewModel` are being overridden by the changes in the backing object. 
That means the data in the `ViewModel` might get lost if external modification of the backing object takes place.
```kotlin
val person = Person("John", "Manager")
val model = PersonModel(person)

model.name.value = "Johnny"   //modify the ViewModel
person.name = "Johan"         //modify the underlying object

println("  Person = ${person.name}, ${person.title}")             //output:   Person = Johan, Manager
println("Is dirty = ${model.isDirty}")                            //output: Is dirty = false
println("   Model = ${model.name.value}, ${model.title.value}")   //output:    Model = Johan, Manager
```
As can be seen above the changes in the `ViewModel` got overridden when the underlying object was modified. 
And the `ViewModel` was not flagged as dirty.

##Dirty Properties

You can check if a specific property is dirty, meaning that it has been changed compared to the backing `source` object value.
```kotlin
val nameWasChanged = model.isDirty(model.name)
```
There is also an extension property version that accomplishes the same task:
```kotlin
val nameWasChanged = model.name.isDirty
```
The shorthand version is an extension val on `Property<T>` but it will only work for properties that are bound inside a `ViewModel`. 
You will find `model.isNotDirty` properties as well.

If you need to dynamically react based on the dirty state of a specific property in the `ViewModel`, you can get a hold of a `BooleanBinding` representing the dirty state of that field like this:
```kotlin
val nameDirtyProperty = model.dirtyStateFor(PersonModel::name)
```
##Extracting the Source Object Value

To retrieve the backing object value for a property you can call `<model>.backingValue(property)`.
```kotlin
val person = model.backingValue(property)
```
Specific Property Subtypes (`IntegerProperty`, `BooleanProperty`)
If you bind, for example, an `IntegerProperty`, the type of the facade property will look like `Property<Int>` but it is in fact an `IntegerProperty` under the hood. 
If you need to access the special functions provided by `IntegerProperty`, you will have to cast the bind result:
```kotlin
val age = bind(Person::ageProperty) as IntegerProperty
```
Similarly, you can expose a read only property by specifying a read only type:
```kotlin
val age = bind(Person::ageProperty) as ReadOnlyIntegerProperty
```
The reason for this is an unfortunate shortcoming on the type system that prevents the compiler from differentiating between overloaded bind functions for these specific types, 
so the single bind function inside `ViewModel` inspects the property type and returns the best match, but unfortunately the return type signature has to be `Property<T>` for now.

##Rebinding

As you saw in the `TableView` example above, it is possible to change the `domain` object that is wrapped by the `ViewModel`.
This test case sheds some more light on that:
```kotlin
@Test fun swap_source_object() {
    val person1 = Person("Person 1")
    val person2 = Person("Person 2")

    val model = PersonModel(person1)
    assertEquals(model.name, "Person 1")

    model.rebind { person = person2 }
    assertEquals(model.name, "Person 2")
}
```
The test creates two `Person` objects and a `ViewModel`. 
The model is initialised with the first `person` object.
It then checks that model.name corresponds to the name in person1. 
Now something weird happens:
```kotlin
model.rebind { person = person2 }
```
The code inside the `rebind()` block above will be executed and all the properties of the model are updated with values from the new `source` object. 
This is actually analogous to writing:
```kotlin
model.person = person2
model.rebind()
```
The form you choose is up to you, but the first form makes sure you do not forget to call rebind.
After rebind is called, the model is not dirty and all values will reflect the ones from the new `source` object or `source` objects.
It's **important** to note that you can pass multiple `source` objects to a view model and update all or some of them as you see fit.

##Rebind Listener

Our `TableView` example called the `rebindOnChange()` function and passed in a `TableView` as the first argument.
This made sure that rebind was called whenever the selection of the `TableView` changed. 
This is actually just a shortcut to another function with the same name that takes an `observable` and calls rebind whenever that observable changes.
If you call this function, you do not need to call rebind manually as long as you have an `observable` that represent the state change that should cause the model to rebind.

As you saw, `TableView` has a shorthand support for the `selectionModel.selectedItemProperty`. 
If not for this shorthand function call, you would have to write it like this:
```kotlin
model.rebindOnChange(table.selectionModel.selectedItemProperty()) {
    item = it ?: Person()
}
```
The above example is included to clarify how the `rebindOnChange()` function works under the hood.
For real use cases involving a `TableView`, you should opt for the `bindSelected(model)` function that is available when you combine `TableView` and `ItemViewModel`.

##ItemViewModel

When working with the `ViewModel` you will notice some repetitive and somewhat verbose tasks. 
They include calling rebind or configuring `rebindOnChange` to change the source object. 
The `ItemViewModel` is an extension to `ViewModel` and in almost all use cases, you will end up inheriting from it instead of the `ViewModel` class.

The `ItemViewModel` has a property called `itemProperty` of the specified type, so our `PersonModel` would now look like:
```kotlin
class PersonModel : ItemViewModel<Person>() {
    val name = bind(Person::nameProperty) 
    val title = bind(Person::titleProperty)
}
```
You will notice we no longer need to pass in the `var person: Person` in the constructor. 
The `ItemViewModel` now has an `observable` property called `itemProperty` and getters/setters via the item property. 
Whenever you assign something to item or via `itemProperty.value`, the model is automatically rebound for you.
There is also an `observable` empty boolean value you can use to check if the `ItemViewModel` is currently holding a `Person`.

The binding expressions need to take into account that it might not represent any item at the time of binding. 
That is why the binding expressions above now use the null safe operator.

We just got rid of some boiler plate, but the `ItemViewModel` gives us a lot more functionality. 
Remember how we bound the selected person from the `TableView` to our model earlier?
```kotlin
// Update the person inside the view model on selection change
model.rebindOnChange(this) { selectedPerson ->
    person = selectedPerson ?: Person()
}
```
Using the `ItemViewModel` this can be rewritten:
```kotlin
// Update the person inside the view model on selection change
bindSelected(model)
```
This will effectively attach the listener we had to write manually before and make sure that the `TableView` selection is visible in the model.

The `save()` function will now also be slightly different, since there is no person property in our model:
```kotlin
private fun save() {
    model.commit()
    val person = model.item
    println("Saving ${person.name} / ${person.title}")
}
```
The person is extracted from the `itemProperty` using the item getter.

##OnCommit callback

Sometimes it's desirable to do a specific action after the model was successfully committed.
The `ViewModel` offers two callbacks, `onCommit` and `onCommit(commits: List<Commit>)`, for that.

The **first** function `onCommit`, has no parameters and will be called after a successful commit, right before the optional successFn is invoked (see: commit).

The **second** function will be called in the same order and with the addition of passing a list of committed properties along.
Each Commit in the list, consists of the original `ObservableValue`, the oldValue and the newValue and a property changed, to signal if the `oldValue` is different then the `newValue`.

Let's look at an example of how we can retrieve only the changed objects and print them to stdout.

To find out which object changed we defined a little extension function, which will find the given property and if it was changed will return the old and new value or null if there was no change.
```kotlin
class PersonModel : ItemViewModel<Person>() {

    val firstname = bind(Person::firstName)
    val lastName = bind(Person::lastName)

    override fun onCommit(commits: List<Commit>) {
       // The println will only be called if findChanged is not null 
       commits.findChanged(firstName)?.let { println("First-Name changed from ${it.second} to ${it.first}")}
       commits.findChanged(lastName)?.let { println("Last-Name changed from ${it.second} to ${it.first}")}
    }

    private fun <T> List<Commit>.findChanged(ref: Property<T>): Pair<T, T>? {
        val commit = find { it.property == ref && it.changed}
        return commit?.let { (it.newValue as T) to (it.oldValue as T) }
    }
}
```
##Injectable Models

Most commonly you will not have both the `TableView` and the editor in the same `View`.
We would then need to access the `ViewModel` from at least two different views, one for the `TableView` and one for the form. 
Luckily, the `ViewModel` is injectable, so we can rewrite our editor example and split the two views:
```kotlin
class PersonList : View("Person List") {
    val persons = listOf(Person("John", "Manager"), Person("Jay", "Worker bee")).observable()
    val model : PersonModel by inject()

    override val root = tableview(persons) {
        title = "Person"
        column("Name", Person::nameProperty)
        column("Title", Person::titleProperty)
        bindSelected(model)
    }
}
```
The person `TableView` now becomes a lot cleaner and easier to reason with. 
However, in a real application, the list of persons would likely come from a controller or a remote call. 
The model is simply injected into the `View`, and we will do the same for the editor:
```kotlin
class PersonEditor : View("Person Editor") {
    val model : PersonModel by inject()

    override val root = form {
        fieldset("Edit person") {
            field("Name") {
                textfield(model.name)
            }
            field("Title") {
                textfield(model.title)
            }
           button("Save") {
                enableWhen(model.dirty)
                action {
                    save()
                }
            }
            button("Reset").action {
                model.rollback()
            }
        }
    }

    private fun save() {
        model.commit()
        println("Saving ${model.item.name} / ${model.item.title}")
    }
}
```
The injected instance of the model will be exactly the same one in both views. 
Again, in a real application the save call would probably be offloaded to a controller _asynchronously_.

##When to Use ViewModel vs ItemViewModel

This chapter has progressed from the **low-level** implementation `ViewModel` into a streamlined `ItemViewModel`.
You might wonder if there are any use cases for inheriting from `ViewModel` instead of `ItemViewModel` at all. 
The answer is that while you would typically extend `ItemViewModel` more than `90%` of the time, there are some use cases where it does not make sense.
Since `ViewModels` can be injected and used to keep navigational state and overall `UI` state, you might use it for situations where you do not have a single domain object - you could have multiple domain objects or just a collection of loose properties. 
In this use case the `ItemViewModel` does not make any sense, and you might implement the `ViewModel` directly.
For common cases though, `ItemViewModel` is your best friend.

There is one potential issue with this approach.
If we want to display multiple `"pairs"` of lists and forms, perhaps in different windows, we need a way to separate and bind the model belonging to a specific pair of list and form.
There are many ways to deal with that, but one tool very well suited for this is the scopes.
Check out the scope documentation for more information about this approach.

##Validation

Almost every application needs to check that the input supplied by the user conforms to a set of rules or are otherwise acceptable.
TornadoFX sports an extensible validation and decoration framework.

We will first look at validation as a standalone feature before we integrate it with the `ViewModel`.

##Under the Hood

The following explanation is a bit verbose and does not reflect the way you would write validation code in your application.
This section will provide you with a solid understanding of how validation works and how the individual pieces fit together.

##Validator

A Validator knows how to inspect user input of a specified type and will return a `ValidationMessage` with a `ValidationSeverity` describing how the input compares to the expected input for a specific control.
If a Validator deems that there is nothing to report for an input value, it returns null. 
A text message can optionally accompany the `ValidationMessage`, and would normally be displayed by the Decorator configured in the `ValidationContext`.
We will cover more on decorators later.

The following severity levels are supported:

`Error` - Input was not accepted

`Warning` - Input is not ideal, but accepted

`Success` - Input is accepted

`Info` - Input is accepted

There are multiple severity levels representing successful input to easier provide the contextually correct feedback in most cases.
For example, you might want to give an informational message for a field no matter the input value, or specifically mark fields with a green `checkbox` when they are entered.
The only severity that will result in an invalid status is the Error level.

##ValidationTrigger

By default, validation will happen when the input value changes.
The input value is always an `ObservableValue<T>`, and the default trigger simply listens for changes.
You can however choose to validate when the input field looses focus, or when a save button is clicked for instance.
The following ValidationTriggers can be configured for each validator:

`OnChange` - Validate when input value changes, optionally after a given delay in milliseconds

`OnBlur` - Validate when the input field looses focus

`Never` - Only validate when `ValidationContext.validate()` is called

##ValidationContext

Normally you would validate user input from multiple controls or input fields at once. You can gather these validators in a ValidationContext so you can check if all validators are valid, or ask the validation context to perform validation for all fields at any given time. The context also controls what kind of decorator will be used to convey the validation message for each field. See the Ad Hoc validation example below.

##Decorator

The decorationProvider of a ValidationContext is in charge of providing feedback when a ValidationMessage is associated with an input. By default this is an instance of SimpleMessageDecorator which will mark the input field with a colored triangle in the topper left corner and display a popup with the message while the input has focus.

Figure 11.2 The default decorator showing a required field validation message

If you don't like the look of the default decorator you can easily create your own by implementing the Decorator interface:
```kotlin

interface Decorator {
    fun decorate(node: Node)
    fun undecorate(node: Node)
}
```
You can assign your decorator to a given `ValidationContext` like this:
```kotlin
context.decorationProvider = MyDecorator()
```
**Tip**: You can create a decorator that applies `CSS` style classes to your inputs instead of overlaying other nodes to provide feedback.

##Ad Hoc Validation

While you will probably never do this in a real application, it is possible to set up a `ValidationContext` and apply validators to it manually. 
The following example is actually taken from the internal tests of the framework.
It illustrates the concept, but is not a practical pattern in an application.
```kotlin
// Create a validation context
val context = ValidationContext()

// Create a TextField we can attach validation to
val input = TextField()

// Define a validator that accepts input longer than 5 chars
val validator = context.addValidator(input, input.textProperty()) {
    if (it!!.length < 5) error("Too short") else null
}

// Simulate user input
input.text = "abc"

// Validation should fail
assertFalse(validator.validate())

// Extract the validation result
val result = validator.result

// The severity should be error
assertTrue(result is ValidationMessage && result.severity == ValidationSeverity.Error)

// Confirm valid input passes validation
input.text = "longvalue"
assertTrue(validator.validate())
assertNull(validator.result)
```
Pay special attention to the last parameter of the `addValidator` call.
It is the actual validation logic. 
The function receives the current input for the property that it validates and must return null if there are no messages, or an instance of `ValidationMessage` if something is noteworthy about the input. 
A message with severity Error will cause the validation to fail.
As you can see, you don't need to instantiate a `ValidationMessage` yourself, simply use one of the functions error, warning, success or info instead.

##Validation with ViewModel

Every `ViewModel` contains a `ValidationContext`, so you don't need to instantiate one yourself. 
The `Validation` framework integrates with the type safe builders as well, and even provides some built in validators, like the required validator.
Going back to our person editor, we can make the input fields required with this simple change:
```kotlin
field("Name") {
    textfield(model.name).required()
}
```
That's all there is to it.
The required validator optionally takes a message that will be presented to the user if the validation fails.
The default text is `"This field is required"`.

Instead of using the built in required validator we can express the same thing manually:
```kotlin
field("Name") {
    textfield(model.name).validator {
        if (it.isNullOrBlank()) error("The name field is required") else null
    }
}
```
If you want to further customize the `textfield`, you might want to add another set of curly braces:
```kotlin
field("Name") {
    textfield(model.name) {
        // Manipulate the text field here
        validator {
            if (it.isNullOrBlank()) error("The name field is required") else null
        }
    }
}
```
##Binding buttons to validation state

You might want to only enable certain buttons in your forms when the input is valid. 
The `model.valid` property can be used for this purpose. 
Since the default validation trigger is `OnChange`, the valid state would only be accurate when you first try to `commit` the model. 
However, if you want to bind a button to the valid state of the model you can call `model.validate(decorateErrors = false)` to force all validators to report their results without actually showing any validation errors to the user.
```kotlin
field("username") {
    textfield(username).required()
}
field("password") {
    passwordfield(password).required()
}
buttonbar {
    button("Login", ButtonBar.ButtonData.OK_DONE) {
        enableWhen(model.valid)
        action {
            model.commit {
                doLogin()
            }
        }
    }
}
// Force validators to update the `model.valid` property
model.validate(decorateErrors = false)
```
**Notice** how the login button's enabled state is bound to the enabled state of the model via `enableWhen { model.valid }` call.
After all the fields and validators are configured, the `model.validate(decorateErrors = false)` make sure the valid state of the model is updated without triggering error decorations on the fields that fail validation. 
The decorators will kick in on value change by default, unless you override the trigger parameter to validator. 
The `required()` built in validator also accepts this parameter.
For example, to only run the validator when the input field looses focus you can call `textfield(username).required(ValidationTrigger.OnBlur)`.

##Validation in dialogs

The dialog builder creates a window with a form and a fieldset and let's you start adding fields to it. 
Some times you don't have a `ViewModel` for such cases, but you might still want to use the features it provides.
For such situations you can instantiate a `ViewModel` inline and hook up one or more properties to it.
Here is an example dialog that requires the user to enter some input in a `textarea`:
```kotlin

dialog("Add note") {
    val model = ViewModel()
    val note = model.bind { SimpleStringProperty() }

    field("Note") {
        textarea(note) {
            required()
            whenDocked { requestFocus() }
        }
    }
    buttonbar {
        button("Save note").action {
            model.commit { doSave() }
        }
    }
}
```

Figure 11.3 A dialog with a inline `ViewModel` context

**Notice** how the note property is connected to the context by specifying it's bean parameter.
This is crucial for making the field validation available.

##Partial commit

It's also possible to do a partial `commit` by supplying a list of fields you want to `commit` in order to avoid committing everything.
This can be convenient in situations where you edit the same `ViewModel` instance from different `Views`, for example in a Wizard.
See the [Wizard] chapter for more information about partial `commit`, and the corresponding partial validation features.

##TableViewEditModel

If you are pressed for screen real estate and do not have space for a master/detail setup with a `TableView`, an effective option is to edit the `TableView` directly. 
By enabling a few streamlined features in TornadoFX, you can not only enable easy cell editing but also enable dirty state tracking, committing, and rollback. 
By calling `enableCellEditing()` and `enableDirtyTracking()`, as well as accessing the `tableViewEditModel` property of a `TableView`, you can easily enable this functionality.

When you edit a cell, a blue flag will indicate its dirty state. 
Calling `rollback()` will revert dirty cells to their original values, whereas `commit()` will set the current values as the new baseline (and remove all dirty state history).
```kotlin
import tornadofx.*

class MyApp: App(MyView::class)
class MyView : View("My View") {

    val controller: CustomerController by inject()
    var tableViewEditModel: TableViewEditModel<Customer> by singleAssign()

    override val root =  borderpane {
        top = buttonbar {
            button("COMMIT").setOnAction {
                tableViewEditModel.commit()
            }
            button("ROLLBACK").setOnAction {
                tableViewEditModel.rollback()
            }
        }
        center = tableview<Customer> {
            items = controller.customers
            isEditable = true

            column("ID",Customer::idProperty)
            column("FIRST NAME", Customer::firstNameProperty).makeEditable()
            column("LAST NAME", Customer::lastNameProperty).makeEditable()

            enableCellEditing() //enables easier cell navigation/editing
            enableDirtyTracking() //flags cells that are dirty

            tableViewEditModel = editModel
        }
    }
}

class CustomerController : Controller() {
    val customers = listOf(
            Customer(1, "Marley", "John"),
            Customer(2, "Schmidt", "Ally"),
            Customer(3, "Johnson", "Eric")
    ).observable()
}

class Customer(id: Int, lastName: String, firstName: String) {
    val lastNameProperty = SimpleStringProperty(this, "lastName", lastName)
    var lastName by lastNameProperty
    val firstNameProperty = SimpleStringProperty(this, "firstName", firstName) 
    var firstName by firstNameProperty
    val idProperty = SimpleIntegerProperty(this, "id", id) 
    var id by idProperty
}
```

Figure 11.4 A `TableView` with dirty state tracking, with `rollback()` and `commit()` functionality.

**Note** also that there are many other helpful properties and functions on the `TableViewEditModel`. 
The items property is an `ObservableMap<S, TableColumnDirtyState<S>>` mapping the dirty state of each record item `S`.
If you want to filter out and commit only dirty records so you can persist them somewhere, you can have your `"Commit"` Button perform this action instead.
```kotlin
button("COMMIT").action {
    tableViewEditModel.items.asSequence()
            .filter { it.value.isDirty }
            .forEach {
                println("Committing ${it.key}")
                it.value.commit()
            }
}
```
There are also `commitSelected()` and `rollbackSelected()` to only commit or rollback the selected records in the `TableView`.
